                <p>
                    Web readers have short attention spans—they’ll decide whether your site has the 
                    information they need in seconds. Structure your content like an upside-down 
                    pyramid or cone. The most important messages go at the top of the page. Then, 
                    gradually drill down to the more specific, supporting information.

                <p>
                    It sounds simple, but so many writers put pen to paper — or finger to keyboard — 
                    before thinking about who it is they’re trying to reach. Before drafting content, 
                    ask yourself these questions: Who is my primary audience? What about a secondary 
                    audience who can influence and inform my primary audience? How will they find my 
                    site online? <strong>...</strong>

                </h3> 
                <p>
                    Long sentences are for Charles Dickens—the short attention span of today’s 
                    reader demands sentences of 35 words or fewer. And according to webpagefx.com, 
                    the average American adult reads at a 7th to 9th-grade level. So website content 
                    that’s accessible and easy to read will naturally reach a wider audience. Focus 
                    on using nouns and verbs; use adverbs <strong>...</strong>

                <p>
                    Use active rather than passive verbs, and specify the subject of the sentence. 
                    For example, rather than writing “A coffee was ordered,” write “The man ordered 
                    a coffee.” Instead of saying “Products can be ordered on our website,” say <strong>...</strong>

                    Don’t limit your prose to generalities and high-level statements. Specific, real-world
