                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Web readers have short attention spans—they’ll decide whether your site has the 
                    information they need in seconds. Structure your content like an upside-down 
                    pyramid or cone. The most important messages go at the top of the page. Then, 
                    gradually drill down to the more specific, supporting information. End with 
                    tangential details.

                <p>
                    &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;For example, say you’re creating a webpage about a conference. The most 
                    pertinent details—a description of the theme, date, and location—would appear 
                    at the top of the page. Supporting details like speakers and their lecture 
                    topics would follow. The less important information—such as conference 
                    organizers, the history of the conference series or a list of related 
                    resources—would appear at the bottom of the page.
